# How I saved a small fortune thanks to Elon Musk

#### 13 Aug 2022

&nbsp;

So the other day I was looking at varius ways to save money thanks to the Energy crisis 
we are in. Coincidentially that day, Elon Musk was on a tweeting spree. I got about 13 tweets back to back from him and 
wondered how much money I'd save if I saved a pound for every one of his tweet.

Thats when this idea dawned to me and I created this smart applet. It basically connects to your twitter and automatically moves a pound to a pot of your choice every time it detects a tweet from Elon Musk. 1 pound can be quite a lot considering he tweets at a rate of 7/day. You can customize the amount.

And so last month, I saved about Â£300. It gave me an illusionary sense having made 300 pounds even though it was my own money. This is because it was all automated. I never noticed the money being moved. I didnt notice any obvious change in my lifestyle either. I hid the pot from the main view when I created it and forgot about it. I adjusted my life unknowlingly according to my bank balance. The end result was a few hundred quid extra to spend at the end of the month. Thats almost like money made if you think about it.

Here is the link to the applet. https://ifttt.com/applets/eYDHXqz7-save-money-every-time-elonmusk-tweets

Note: Your capital is at risk if you forget that the money is in a pot and I will not be taking any liability of that.
