# How I saved a small fortune thanks to Elon Musk

So the other day I was looking at varius ways to save money thanks to the Energy crisis 
we are in. I came across this 1p challenge in a subreddit and I thought I would try it out.
That day, Elon musk was on a tweeting spree. I got about 13 tweets back to back from the guy and 
wondered how much money I'd save if I saved a pound for every one of his tweet.

Thats when this idea dawned to me and I created this smart applet. It basically connects to your twitter and automatically moves a pound to a pot of your choice every time it detects a tweet from Elon Musk. 1 pound can be quite a lot considering he tweets quite a lot. You can customize the amount. Here is the link to the applet. https://ifttt.com/applets/eYDHXqz7-save-money-every-time-elonmusk-tweets

Last month, I saved about Â£300. It gave me an illusionary sense having made 300 pounds even though it was my own money. This is because it was all automated. I never noticed the money being moved. I didnt notice any obvious change in my lifestyle either. I hid the pot from the main view when I created it and forgot about it. I adjusted my life according to my bank balance. The end result was a few hundred quid extra to spend at the end of the month. 

Note: Your capital is at risk if you forget that the money is in a pot.
