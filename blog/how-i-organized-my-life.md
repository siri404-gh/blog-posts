# How I organized my life

#### 09 Aug 2019, London

&nbsp;

About 6 years ago when I moved to London for the first time, I realized my life was all over the place. It was running ahead of me and I was
constantly playing catchup. Being on top of everything was just impossible. I was wasting a lot of reading spam emails and wateful notifications. I noticed I was spending a big chunk of the day just fixing one thing or the other. I couldnt focus on my life or work. I had to come up with something. Fast forward today, I have created a system around me which has made my life smooth. If you are a person like me who travels quite a lot, pays taxes, invests and has a busy life generally, you might find this interesting.

## Categories of Life

Around 2017, I thought in depth about what life is and where mine was leading to. Asked myself what I really needed in life, what truly makes me feel accomplished, what truly makes life less mundane, monotonous and worth living every second to the fullest doing the things which actually are worth doing. This is when I came with my life circle diagram. I went back to the drawingboard and did some soul searching and came up with a list of 10-12 categories of life. Organising everything around these categories has helped me streamline all the events in my life. I then chose what to prioritise and work on. Over time, these 12 categories grew to about 15 and some minor ones. As of today, they are: 

Accommodation, Business, Career, Entertainment, Family, Finance, Food, Health, Learning, Social, Shopping, Tax, Travel, Visa and Work

The whole plan was to act on all these areas. If Software Engineering has taught me anything, it is that you build bing things over a long period of time. There will be setbacks here and there, but its the long term that matters. I set out goals I wanted to achieve in each of these areas. I then took action. Read ahead.

## Emails

Being a web developer meant that a third of my life is spent on the internet. I had several email accounts mostly I created over the years 
for various purposes. First thing I did was delete all the unneccessary accounts and move everything to a single one. But the problem with
this was there were too many emails. There were hundreds of emails everyday from various sources that I had to do something about it so as to not miss the important ones. I started creating email filters for recurring emails into these categories. Each of these categories then have their sub categories. For example, a mail from my bank would go into a folder inside Finance and will not be available in the inbox. This way, I can pick and choose which emails to read and I can take collective action on a specific category of emails.


## Apps

I realized that we never use our phones to their fullest potential. These are powerful devices with amazing computing powers which can actually do work while you sleep. I mean shouldnt it be possible for your phone to automatically invest in a stock when its low and sell it when it is at its peak? Arent they smart enough to make these decisions for us without manual interventins? So thats exactly what I set out to do. I divided all my apps into these categories. For example, the reminders app reminds of important dates. The investment apps tell me when I need to sell something. The health apps monitor my heart rates. These are just a few things. Its all there in the palm of my hand. Here is a screenshot of it.

## Documents

I had documents from School, college, scans of ids, bills, statements, rental agreements, visa appications, tax documents, tickets and several other documents. They were all over the place. Some physical, some digital, some back home in India. I had to come up with a way of storing these somewhere in such a way I can access them anywhere. I had everything digitized and moved them to the cloud. I initially tried Dropbox, box, and some other lesser known cloud storage providers before Google Drive was a thing. When Google Drive came up, 15 GB of storage was plenty to store all these documents. So in Google drive, I have folders for all of the above categories and uploaded all the files there. Thats not it. The amazing thing is the Google Drive software makes sure I have a copy of the drive synced with the cloud in my laptop and mobile phone at all times. Also this way, I realized there is no need of a physical drive. Today, the files have crossed the 15GB limit and I subscribed to Google One. I think its a handy subscription. Lets take a Flight ticket to London for example. In the olden days, I would print it, print the boarding pass, keep it somewhere so I wouldnt lose it and chaos ensues on the day of travel. With Google drive, once I buy the ticket, I create a folder called 'London Trip 2022' in the travel folder. I then upload the ticket and the boarding pass into the drive. It gets synced to my laptop and phone automatically. All in all, no copying, no hard disk space required and no losing or misplacing tickets and no worrying about where I kept it. To me, that was a big win. The days of having to use the flash drive were over.

## Photos and videos

I digitized and uploaded all my old pictures into Google Photos. I do not own a camera. My iPhone does a good job of capturing all the necessary memories in my life. The Google Photos app then backs up all the pictures into the cloud. This way, I dont have to copy them somewhere because its all backed up in the cloud automatically, I dont lose any pictures either and I can safely delete the pictures on my phone saving valuable space. Whenever I get time, I organize these photos into albums.

## Passwords

Password management deserves a book of its own. Living in the virtual world, having signed up to a ton of services, remembering passwords was impossible. I initally wrote them all in a place. But that was not very secure. It is the dumbest thing anyone can do. So I came up with a system of creating passwords for websites in such a way I dont have to write them anywhere. It was a combination of a secret keyword, name of the website and a number and character. But that didnt work either. Half of them required changing passwords every now and then. So I tried numbering the passwords incrementing by 1 every time I changed it. This proved to be even more chaotic as now I had to remember their counts. All of a sudden, I had some with my old insecure password, some with the password system, and some I didnt even remember. This is when I truly sat and thought about that to do. Social login to the rescue. If you dont know about Social login, its good to read about their pros and cons. I decided to use it wherever they allowed it. It took precendence over normal passwords. And in websites where they didnt have social login, I would let the browser create a secure password and let a password manager like Google password manager remember it. With chrome settings being synced to me google account, this meant that I didnt have to remember any of my passwords. Chrome did the remembering of the passwords. The problems didnt end there though. Although in my laptop, Chrome acted as the password manager, I was using an iPhone and the passwords there were managed by the keychain. I had to make it use Chrome as the password manager. There are still certain apps which use the Safari webviews. Webviews are basically instances of the native browser inside an app. If you have noticed certain apps to be sluggish, it probably was because they were using webviews in that journey. I still havent figured out a way to change this. Moving to an android device seems to be the only choice as of today.
