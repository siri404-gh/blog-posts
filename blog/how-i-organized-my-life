# How I organize my life

#### 09 Aug 2019, London

About 6 years ago when I moved to London for the first time, I realized my life was all over the place. It was running ahead of me and I was
constantly trying to catch up with it. Being on top of everything was just impossible. Fast forward today, I have created a system around me 
which has made my life smooth. If you are a person like me who travels quite a lot, pays taxes, invests and has a busy life generally, you
might find this interesting.

## Life

I thought in depth about what life is and where mine was leading to. Asked myself what I really need in life, what truly makes me feel accomplished,
what truly makes life less mundane, monotonous and worth living every second to the fullest. This is when I came with my life circle diagram.
I went back to the drawingboard and did some soul searching and came up with a list of 10-12 categories of life. Organising everything around these
categories has helped me streamline all the events in my life. I then chose what to prioritise and work on. Over time, these 12 categories grew to 
about 16. As of now they are: 

1. Accommodation
2. Business
3. Career
4. Entertainment
5. Family
6. Finance
7. Food
8. Health
9. Investments
10. Learning
11. Social
12. Shopping
13. Tax
14. Travel
15. Visa
16. Work

The whole plan was to act on all these areas. I set out goals I wanted to achieve in these areas. I then took action. Read ahead.


## Emails

Being a web developer meant that a third of my life is spent on the internet. I had several email accounts mostly I created over the years 
for various purposes. First thing I did was delete all the unneccessary accounts and move everything to a single one. But the problem with
this was there were too many emails. There were hundreds of emails everyday from various sources that I had to do something about it so as to not
miss the important ones. I started creating email filters for recurring emails into these categories. Each of these categories then have their sub categories.
For example, a mail from my bank would go into a folder inside Finance and will not be available in the inbox. This way, I can pick and choose 
which emails to read and I can take collective action on a specific category of emails.

## Cloud Storage

I had documents from School, college, scans of ids, bills, statements, rental agreements, visa appications, tax documents, tickets and several other documents.
I had to come up with a way of storing these somewhere in such a way I can access them anywhere. I initially tried Dropbox, box, and some other lesser known
cloud storage providers before Google Drive was a thing. When Google Drive came up, 15 GB of storage was plenty to store all these documents.
So in Google drive, I have folders for all of the above categories and uploaded all the files there. Thats not it. The Google Drive software makes sure
I have a copy of the drive synced with the cloud in my laptop at all times. Also this way, I realized there is no need of a physical drive. Today,
the files have crossed the 15GB limit and I subscribed to Google One. I think its a handy subscription.
Lets take a Flight ticket to New York for example. Once I buy the ticket, I create a folder called 'New York Trip 2022' in the travel folder. I then
upload the ticket into the drive. It gets synced to my laptop and phone automatically. All in all, no copying, no hard disk space required and no losing files.
To me, its a big win.

## Photos and videos

I do not own a camera. My iphone captures all the necessary memories in my life. Google photos then backs up all the pictures into the cloud. This way,
I dont have to copy them somewhere because its all backed up in the cloud, I dont lose any pictures either and I can safely delete the pictures on my phone 
saving valuable space.

## Apps

I realized that we never use our phones to their fullest potential. These are powerful computers which can actually do work while you sleep. So I set
out to divide all my apps into these categories. I can just open one when I need something, plus I have notifications set up which indicate 
important stuff. For example, the reminders app reminds of important dates. The investment apps tell me when I need to sell something. The health apps
prompt me to measure my health stats. These are just a few things. Its all there in the palm of my hand. Here is a screenshot of it.
