# 11. Container With Most Water

&nbsp;

## Problem

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

## Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} height
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxArea = function(height) {
    let p1 = 0
    let p2 = height.length - 1
    let max = 0
    
    while (p1 < p2) {
      const area = Math.min(height[p1], height[p2]) * (p2 - p1)
      max = Math.max(max, area)
      if (height[p1] > height[p2]) p2--
      else p1++
    }
    
  return max
};
```
