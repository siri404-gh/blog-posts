# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

#### 02 Jun 2021, Berlin

<br />

Hi there! I am Sreeram. I am a Web Developer/Software Engineer. I hail from India from the city of Trivandrum. 
I work for Bumble in London. Ever since 2011, my job has taken me around the world to work for some great organisations amongst some of the best minds in the world.

Outside of work, I am enroute getting my private pilots license. Its the high octane activity I engage in which takes my mind away from code and computers sometimes. 

I also have a keen interest in teaching. I teach web development and programming online. I used to be a bad student during my schooling days and I realized late that I had the potential to do way better and I have developed 
my own idea of how teching is to be done. I guess everybody have one.

I travel regularly and have so far been to about 15 countries. I try to spend summers in Europe visiting my friends there and winters in India where my parents are. 

I cook, mostly Indian, but I am expanding my repertoire to other cuisines. 

I speak a few languages - Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi, and English. I have learnt a bit of Sanskrit and Deutsch too. 

I play a lot of cricket during the summer months. A cringeworthy thing is from 2015 to 2017 I practiced every day to be able to play in 2019 Cricket World cup. Didnt succeed. 
I also run, swim, play tennis, badminton, football and table tennis.

I tend to have strong opinions on socio-political issues around the world, sometimes controversial.

I am meticulous and abmitious and I move steadfast towards my goals. Head to my [twitter](https://twitter.com/sreeramofficial) page to see my life rules.
