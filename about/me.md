# Hello, World! 👋

#### 02 Jun 2021, Berlin

<br />

Hi there! I am Sreeram. I am a Frontend Engineer working for Bumble Inc in London, UK. 

I hail from India from the beautiful city of [Thiruvananthapuram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvananthapuram) in coastal [Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala) 🌴 in India 🇮🇳. Ever since 2011, my job has taken me around the world to work for some great organisations amongst some of the best minds in the world. I have also lived in Europe 🇪🇺 (mostly Germany 🇩🇪) for a couple of years.

At work, I am in the Design Systems team. We create all the design elements you see in the Bumble dating app and all the infrasturcture around it.

Outside of work, I travel regularly and have so far been to about 15 countries. I try to spend summers in Europe visiting my friends there and winters in India where my parents are. I cook, mostly Indian, but I am expanding my repertoire to other cuisines. I speak a few languages - Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi, and English. I have learnt a bit of Sanskrit and Deutsch too. I play a lot of cricket 🏏 during the summer months. I also run, swim, play tennis, badminton, football and table tennis. I tend to have strong opinions on socio-political issues around the world, sometimes controversial. I am meticulous and abmitious and I move steadfast towards my goals. I am also enroute getting my private pilots license. Its the high octane activity I engage in which takes my mind away from code and computers sometimes. Head to my [Twitter](https://twitter.sreeram.io/) page to see my life rules or my [Instagram](https://instagram.sreeram.io) for my life in pictures.
